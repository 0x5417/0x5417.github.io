## What is the road to $1M?

One of my goals in life is to obtain 1 million USD in today's dollars.
Why would anyone want this? The answer is simple. ***Freedom***.
I want the ability to control my time from the minute I wake up to the minute I go to bed.

Having $1M would allow me to achieve this. I could happily live off interest and do whatever I want all day long.
$1M would allow me to live a simple, worry free life.

## Isn't it unreasonable to think a random person can make $1M early in life?

Not at all! Especially with the power of **compound interest**.
My strategy is incredibly simple to follow and I think anyone can do it as well.
I will live well below my means and invest the remainder of my income into **index funds**.
This blog will serve as an archive of the decisions I make during this process.
