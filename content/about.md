## Thanks for checking out my blog!

I am a 21 year old software engineer with a passion for alcohol, drugs and gambling.
I am a connoisseur when it comes to finer things in life.
In my free time I enjoy taking long walks around the neighborhood.

I am a fan of dry and dark humor so please don't take anything here too seriously.

## Do you want a cool website like mine?

[Contact me!](mailto:me@daydrinking.dev)
I will make you a site (static or dynamic), and host it for you for incredibly cheap.
I will teach you how to edit and make it your own too if you want!
